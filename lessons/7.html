            <h1>Lesson 7: Arrays</h1>
            
            <p>An array is used to hold a bunch of variables so that they will all be next to each other in memory,
            so that they can all be easily accessed. Think of it like having a shelf with a bunch of books on it.
            Here is how to create and array that will hold 5 integers: </p>

	        <p class="indent">int[5] arr;</p>

            <p>The value inside the square brackets is the size of the array.</p>

            <p>This is how you access items in your array:</p>

        	<p class="indent">arr[0]; <br/>
        	arr[1]; <br/>
        	arr[2]; <br/>
        	arr[3]; <br/>
        	arr[4]; </p>

            <p>The address of the first item is 0. The address of the last item is going to be the size of the array minus 1.
            So arr[4] is the last item in the array.</p>

            <p>Each element in the array can be treated as its own variable. You can perform math on it,
            you can set its value. Anything that you can do with a variable you can do with an array item.
            The code below plays around with elements in the array:</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCb5/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>You can populate the contents of an array when you create it, like so:</p>

            <p class="indent">int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };</p>

            <p>You can leave out the size of the array when you are initializing it. 
            The compiler is smart enough to know that if you initialize an array with 5 values then the
            size of the array must also be 5. However, if you do not initialize, then you will need to
            specify the size.</p>

            <p>When you create an array without initializing it, the array will be full of junk data.</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCb6/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>However, if you initialize one of the values, then all of the other ones will be initialized to 0.</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCb8/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>Of course, you can create arrays for all the variable types: floats, doubles, chars, and strings.
            Actually, strings themselves are just arrays of characters. 
            The original C programming language didn't even have strings, just character arrays.</p>

            <p>We talked about for loops in the previous section. For loops are particularly useful for accessing 
            the elements of array. The program below fills each item with an array with random numbers.</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCba/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>I haven't gone into random numbers yet, so I thought I would bring it up here.
            The procedure for creating arrays is as follows:</p>

            <p>You will need to put these at the top of your code:</p>

            <p class="indent">#include &ltcstdlib&gt <br/>
            #include &ltctime&gt</p>

            <p>Next you will need to seed the random number generator. The easiest way to do this
            is to use this line of code:</p>

            <p class="indent">srand(time(NULL));</p>

            <p>This uses the current time as the seed for the random number generator. </p>
            
            <p>Then whenever you want a random number, you can do something like this: </p>
            
            <p class="indent">int randomNumber = rand(); </p>
            
            <p>If you want your random number to be in a certain range, you can use the modulo operator: </p>
            
            <p class="indent">int randomNumber = rand() % 6; </p>
            
            <p>This will give you a number between 0 and 5. If you want the number to be between 1 and 6,
            simply add one to the random number: </p>
            
            <p class="indent">int randomNumber = rand() % 6 + 1; </p>
            
            <p>This will give you a random number between 1 and 6, which would be good to simulate a dice roll.
            If you are interested in completing the casino project (listed in the projects tab), 
            then you can refer back to this. </p>
             
            <p>One last thing I want to mention about arrays. If you want to copy an array, you might think it
            would be as simple as this: </p>
            
            <p class="indent">yourArray = myArray; </p>
            
            <p>But in actuality, this will not work. To copy the contents of an array to another: 
            you will need to use a for loop like so: </p>
            
            <p class="indent">for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp yourArray[i] = myArray[i]; <br/>
            } </p>
            
            <p>On to some exercises! </p>
            
            <div id="1" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 1: Holding user input </h3>
                
                <p>Ask the user how many values they want to store. Read in a bunch of values from the user
                and store values in array. Then print the contents of the array using a for loop, along with
                the sum and the average. </p>
            </div>
                
            <div id="2" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 2: How many? </h3>
                
                <p>Same setup as before, but this time count the number of evens, odds, zeros, and negatives. </p>
            </div>
                
            <div id="3" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 3: Lotto numbers </h3>
                
                <p>We need five numbers between 1 and 41. Use the random number generator and put these numbers
                in an array. Then print these to the screen. </p>
            
                <p>For extra challenge, try and make it so that all of these numbers are different 
                (there are many different ways to do this, think about it). </p>
