                <p>Hello, welcome to Jeffrey Barlow's Learn Programming
                Website. This online course will be geared to those with little or no prior
                programming experience.</p>
                
                <p>First, let me explain what is programming. Programming is
                giving instructions to a computer so that it can solve a particular problem.
                Computers consist of millions of tiny transistors which send out pulses of 1's
                and 0's. Somehow, this allows computers to perform complex operations, and even
                produce the visuals you see on your screen right now. The exact details of the
                inner workings of a computer are outside the scope of the course, however, it
                is my hope that this website will at least shed a little light on how computers
                can do all of the things that they do.</p>
                
                <p>While it is possible to program solely by feeding 1's and
                0's into a computer, it is not the only way. Programming languages take
                instructions which resemble English and turn them into machine language for the
                computer to execute.</p>
                
                <p>The language we will be working with is C++. It is the same
                language I started working with when I began studying computer science in
                college. C++ was created in the 70's and 80's. As its name implies, it is based
                off an earlier called C, though with some additions, hence the pluses in the
                title. </p>
                
                <p>C++, despite being relatively old, is still one of the most
                widely used languages for programming. However, it is far from being the only
                language out there. There are thousands of programming languages in existence.
                If you know a programmer yourself, there is a chance they might not have ever
                used C++ in their work. You might wonder why there should be so many different
                languages. Well, the answer is we need different tools for different jobs.
                Also, there will always be somebody who will pop up thinking they can do better
                than what is already on the market.</p>
                
                <p>C++ is a good, standard language to start out with. When you
                take Driver's Ed, do you drive a Ferrari, or do you drive a Ford Taurus?
                Learning C++ will also put you in a good position to learn other languages like
                C and Java which are widely used.</p>
                
                <p>One last thing I want to mention, programming is as much a
                craft as cooking or building bird houses. The more you practice, the better you
                get. This website will give you a start, but you never really will stop
                learning should you decide to continue in this field.</p>
