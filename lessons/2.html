            <h1>Lesson 2: "Hello World"</h1>
            
                <p>Programmers are sticklers for tradition. 
                So, when introducing a new programming language, 
                it is customary to begin by showing a little program which simply prints 
               "Hello world" to the screen.</p>
                
                <p>Have a looksee at the code below you. Click the run button next to
                the little panel below to see what it does.</p>
                
                
                <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCaf/0.js"></script></div>
                
                <p>Try experimenting with changing things around, see what happens.
                You might get a few errors, but that's okay.
                Learn what works and what doesn't. 
                Particularly see if you can print other things to the screen besides "hello world".</p>
                
                <p>The following image will break down for you what everything does.</p>
                
                <img src="../images/helloworld.png"  alt="Hello world!">
                
                <p>Now is the time I give you some guidelines on basic formatting in C++.
                One thing that you will very quickly find out is that C++ is very picky
                about making sure that everything is formatted correctly. Simply misplacing
                a piece of punctuation might make it so that the program will not work. 
                Here are some rules: </p>
                
                <p class="indent">1. Every time you use an opening brace { there must also be a closing brace }. </p>
                
                <p class="indent">2. The same rule applies to parentheses. ( )</p>
                
                <p class="indent">3. Almost every statement you write must have a semicolon at the end. 
                This is one of the weird things about C++, since not all languages require you to do this. 
                You will notice from the program above that "#include &ltiostream&gt" and "int main()" do not end with semicolons. 
                The reason for that is simple: they are just exceptions.</p>
                
                <p class="indent">4. Anything you write after two forward slashes will be ignored by the compiler.
                Here is an example:</p>
                
                <p class="doubleindent">//ergerjhfigheiogheioghiohgiohg</p>
                
                <p class="indent">5. When writing cout statements, you just have to follow the format. </p>
                
                <p class="doubleindent">cout << "Your text here";</p>
                
                <p>You can put comments in your code and it will not affect the output. 
                The two slashes indicate that you are about to write a comment. 
                Comments are used to provide explanations for what the code does and how it works. 
                These are very important especially when other people need to read your code. 
                Here it is in action.</p>
                
                <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCak/0.js"></script></div>
                
                <p>If you want to move to the next line after printing something, try this:</p>
                
                <p class="indent">cout << "This is the first line." << endl;</p>
                <p class="indent">cout <<"This is the second line.";</p>
                
                <p>The endl is short for end line, hopefully that is not too confusing. 
                Without it, both of those statements would show up on the same line. 
                Another way to move to the next line is with the newline character '\n'.</p>
                
                <p class="indent">cout << "This is the first line.\n";</p>
                <p class="indent">cout <<"This is the second line.";</p>
                
                <p>This requires less typing which you may prefer.</p>
                
                <p>We will go into making your output prettier in later lessons.</p>
