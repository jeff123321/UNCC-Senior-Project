            <h1>Lesson 4: Getting input from the user</h1>
            
            <p>But just printing stuff to the screen is boring. 
            Let us instead try and get some information from the user,
            that way our programs can actually do stuff.</p>

            <p>Here is an example. This program will get a number from the user
            and then tell you what that number squared is. Check it out: </p>
            
            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCan/1.js"></script></div>

            <p>The program returns exactly the answer it is supposed to.</p>

            <p>Look carefully at the line after where it says "Give me a number".</p>

            <p class="indent">cin >> num;</p>

            <p>cin works the exact opposite from cout. Also notice how the arrows are pointing the other direction.
            They are pointing towards the variable to signify that information is being loaded into them.
            When you are writing your own programs, pay close attention to which way the arrows are pointing,
            as this can cause a great deal many errors.</p>

            <p>Let's look at all the different math operations available to you:</p>
            
            <table id="operators">
                <tr>
                  <th colspan="4">Math Operators</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>    
                    <td>+ <br/> Addition</td>
                    <td>- <br/> Subtraction</td>
                    <td>* <br/> Multiplication</td>	
                    <td>/ <br/> Division</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>() <br/> Parentheses</td>	
                    <td>% <br/> Modulus</td>
                    <td>num++ <br/> Increment by one</td>
                    <td>num-- <br/> Decrement by one</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td colspan="2">= <br/> Assignment operator</td>	
                    <td colspan="2">pow(num, 2) <br/> Power function (you will need to #include &ltcmath&gt for this)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>Some important things to mention:</p>

            <p>You may remember from math class that parentheses can be used to signify multiplication.
            Like 5(3) = 15. You can't do that in C++, you will get an error. Instead type 5 * 3.</p>
            
            <p>Use parentheses if you want to influence the order the operations will be evaluated in.
            
            <p class="indent">5 * 4 + 2 = 22</p>
            
            <p class="indent">5 * (4 + 2) = 30</p>
            
            <p>The modulus operator will return the remainder after you perform division with two integers. 
            
            <p class="indent">5 % 2 = 1. </p>
            
            <p>2 goes into 5 twice, and the remainder is 1. The modulus operator is a very useful tool,
            and we will see why it is so important in future exercises.</p>
            
            <p>A problem may occur when you divide two integers. For example, run the program below and 
            see what happens.</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCav/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>You might be thinking that 5 / 2 will give you 2.5, but instead you get 2.
            Why is that? Well, when you divide two integers, the compiler will assume you are doing integer division,
            which means no decimal parts in the answer. 2 goes into 5 twice. So 2 is the answer we get.</p>
            
            <p>How do we fix this, run the program below and find out:</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCax/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>This will force the compiler to treat your numbers a floating point numbers, which have decimals.</p>
            
            <p>One last thing to mention: The equals sign is for assigning new values to your variables.
            You can even use this to update the value of your number based off its previous value:</p>
            
        	<p class="indent">int num = 5; <br/>
        	num = num + 1; <br/>
        	//now the number is 6</p>
            
            <p>num = num + 1 may seem like a mathematical absurdity, but remember that the equal sign
            is used for assigning values, not necessarily what it means in math class.</p>
            
            <p>Another way to write this is:</p>
            
            <p class="indent">num += 1;</p>
            
            <p>This does the same thing as above, but now there is no mathematical absurdity.</p>
            
            <p>Check out this program. Try and figure out the result:</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCay/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>That is some crazy use of the different math operators available to you.</p>
            
            <p>Now, let us dive into some exercises.</p>
            
            <div id="1" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 1: Area of a rectangle</h3>
                
                <p>Write a program that will ask the user for the length and width of a rectangle.
                The program will then multiply the two numbers and show the area of the rectangle.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="2" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 2: Area of a circle</h3>
                
                <p>Write a program that will ask the user for the radius of a circle. Then, 
                show the user the area of the circle by doing radius times radius times PI.</p>
                
                <p>*make sure you make the value PI a constant.</p> 
                <p class="indent">const float PI = 3.14;</p>
            </div>
                
            <div id="3" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 3: Swapping two values</h3>
                
                <p>Write a program that will ask the user for two integers, the program will store these as
                num1 and num2. Then the program will swap the values of num1 and num2, and then print these
                to the screen.</p>
            
                <p>Hint: If you just do </p>
                
            	<p class="indent">num1 = num2; <br/>
            	num2 = num1;</p>
                
                <p>Then both numbers will be the same. You need to create a third variable, num3, to help
                in the switching.</p>
            </div>
                
            <div id="4" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 4: Finding the average</h3>
                
                <p>Write a program that will ask the user for three numbers. 
                These numbers will be added up and divided by three, which will give you the average. 
                Use your parentheses wisely, and be careful with your division. 
                We want our answer to allow for decimals.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="5" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 5: Converting temperatures</h3>
                
                <p>Write a program that will ask the user for a temperature in Celsius.
                Then convert that temperature to Fahrenheit. If you don't remember, 
                the formula is multiply the temperature by 1.8, and then add 32.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="6" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 6: Total cost after tax</h3>
                
                <p>Write a program that will ask the user for the cost of an item.
                Then figure out the total cost after sales tax is added. 
                Assume a tax rate of 7.5%. Store the tax rate as a constant.</p>
                
                <p> Hint: You will be multiplying the cost by (1 + 0.075)</p>
                
                <p>Whew, that's a lot of exercises. If you could make it through all that,
                then you are in good shape to move on to the next section!</p>
