            <h1>Lesson 5: Decision Making</h1>
            
            <p>We want our programs to be able to perform different actions depending on certain conditions. 
            To do this, we will use if..else... statements. These are used in all kinds of programming languages,
            not just C++. Here is the basic structure of an if.. else.. statement:</p>

            <p class="indent">if(some condition) <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp some things to do <br/>
            } <br/>
            else <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp if the condition is not met, do this instead <br/>
            } </p>
            
            <p>Note the else part is optional. Also, if there is just one line of code after your if,
            then the curly braces are optional. If you want to check for multiple conditions,
            you can use if..else if.. else structure.</p>
            
        	<p class="indent">if(some condition) <br/>
        	{ <br/>
        	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp some things to do <br/>
        	} <br/>
        	else if(another condition) <br/>
        	{ <br/>
        	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp some other things to do <br/>
        	} <br/>
        	else <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp if all else fails, do this <br/>
            } </p>
            
            <p>You can put as many else ifs as you want.</p>
            
            <p>Take a look at this very simple program here. Play around with it by entering in different numbers.</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbD/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>What this program does is compare your number to the number 3. If it is different,
            then it will display the difference.</p>
            
            <p>Let's look at how we can compare numbers in C++:</p>
            
             <table id="operators">
                <tr>
                  <th colspan="2">Comparison Operators</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>    
                    <td>&lt<br/> Less than</td>
                    <td>&gt<br/> Greater than</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>&lt= <br/> Less than or equal to</td>	
                    <td>&gt= <br/> Greater than or equal to</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>== <br/> Equal to</td>	
                    <td>!= <br/> Not equal to</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>Now, if you want to check for more than one condition in an if statement,
            you will need to use these logical operators: </p>
            
            <table id="operators">
                <tr>
                  <th colspan="3">Logical Operators</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>    
                    <td>|| <br/> OR operator <br/> (at least one condition has to be true) </td>
                    <td>&& <br/> AND operator <br/> (both conditions must be true)</td>
                    <td>! <br/> NOT operator <br/> (will invert the truth value of certain statement)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            
            <p>Here is an example of all the OR operator in use:</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbE/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>Notice I couldn't have used the and operator because there is no way a number can be less
            than 1 and greater than 10. </p>
            
            <p>Also, if you are having trouble finding || on your keyboard, it is right between the
            backspace and the enter key on the right side of your keyboard. The bottom symbol is \
            but if you hold shift you will get |. </p>
            
            <p>Here is the AND operator in use: </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbF/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>If you will notice, this program does the exact same thing as the one before it.
            But look at the logic behind it. This one checks if the number is greater than 1 and less than 10,
            then it will print the number you entered. Otherwise, it tells you that you have made a mistake.</p>
            
            <h2>Cases</h2>
            
            <p>Let us look at another kind of decision making tool: case structures.</p>
            
            <p>Case structures are useful when a variable can take one of several different values,
            and you want to have something planned for each of them. Here is the basic structure of one.</p>

            <p class="indent">switch(num) <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp case 1: <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp something to do <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp break; <br/>
            case 2: <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp something to do <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp break; <br/>
            case 3: <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp something to do <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp break; <br/>
            
            default: <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp something to do <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp break; <br/>
            } </p>

            <p>The default will execute if the number does not meet any of the above criteria.
            The breaks that you see are due to a peculiarity in how case statements work in C++.
            Without the breaks, all the code below the case will get executed.</p>

            <p>Case structures are often used for menus. Here is a menu for a virtual casino:</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbL/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>Try removing the breaks and see what happens.</p>
            
            <p>Case structures can also be used with characters. Here is an example:</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbO/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>Notice how I was able to cleverly omit break statements in order to account for
            upper and lowercase letters. I wish I could say I thought of that myself, but I didn't. </p>
            
            <p>Now, it is finally time for some exercises!</p>
            
            <div id="1" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 1: Which one is larger?</h3>
                
                <p>The user will enter in two numbers. The program will tell the user which number 
                they entered is larger.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="2" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 2: Even or odd</h3>
                
                <p>The user will enter an integer. Tell them if it is even or odd. 
                Use the modulus operator (%).</p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="3" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 3: What is the letter grade?</h3>
                
                <p>The user will enter the percentage they got on the test. 
                Tell them what letter grade they deserve. Use the 7 point scale:</p>
                
                <p class="indent">100 - 93: A <br/>
                92 - 85: B <br/>
                84 - 77: C <br/>
                77 - 70: D <br/>
                69 and below: F<p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="4" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 4: F to C, and vice versa.</h3>
            
                <p>The user will enter in a temperature. Then the program will ask you if that temperature is 
                in Fahrenheit or Celsius. The user will enter either an F or a C.
                Give them the temperature in the other scale.</p>
                
                <p class="indent">F = (5/9) * C + 32 <br/>
                C = (F - 32) * (9/5) </p>
                
                <p>You can easily figure out these formulas if you can remember the boiling points
                in these two scales.</p>
