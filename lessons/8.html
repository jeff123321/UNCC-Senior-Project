            <h1>Lesson 8: Functions</h1>
            
            <p>Functions are a useful way to clean up your code and reduce how much typing you have to do.
            Functions go before main, but after all the #include and using namespace std statements. </p>

            <p>Here is an example of a function. </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbd/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>The function is named sayHello. It takes a string for a name, and then it prints hello 
            to the screen along with the name. In my main, I create a string name, and then I pass the
            name to the function, and the function does what it does with my name. </p>
            
           <p>Let's look at the function more carefully. </p>
            
            <p class="indent">void sayHello(string name) <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp cout << "Hello " << name << "!"; <br/>
            } </p>
            
            <p>void means that the function does not return any values. sayHello is the name of the function.
            In parenthesis are the arguments it will take. Inside the curly braces is the function body, 
            which is what gets executed when the function is called. </p>
            
            <p>Let's look at another example: </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbe/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>This function will give you a random number between 1 and 6, just like a die would.
            Instead of having to write out rand() % 6 + 1 over and over again, you can just call
            your rollDice() function. </p>
            
            <p>Let's look at the function more closely. </p>
            
            <p class="indent">int rollDice() <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp //generates a random number between 1 and 6 <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp return rand() % 6 + 1; <br/>
            }</p>
            
            <p>This function returns an integer, that's what the int up front means. 
            rollDice is the name of the function. In parentheses are the arguments that the function will take.
            This function takes no arguments, so there is nothing in the parentheses. </p>
            
            <p>So let's summarize the process of writing a function: </p>
            
            <p class="indent">1. First put the data type of the result of the function. This can be an integer, 
            a boolean, a string, a double, a character, or anything you want. If you don't want to return anything,
            you just put void.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">2. After the data type, you will put the name of the function. </p>
            
            <p class="indent">3. In parentheses, put the arguments that your function will take. If there are no arguments
            you want to take, just leave the parentheses empty. </p>
            
            <p class="indent">4. Then write the code for the function in curly braces {}. </p>
            
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            
            <p>Remember, when we were talking about scope in the section on loops. A variable that you
            create in your main will not be accessible to your functions. If you want a variable to be 
            accessible to your functions, you will have to pass it as an argument, or you can do something else,
            which I will show you now in this example: </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbi/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>Look below the using namespace std line, you can see that I created a constant variable called
            SALES_TAX_RATE. Because I created this variable outside of all the functions, the variable is
            accessible by all of the functions. This is called a globally defined variable because you can
            access it from anywhere. </p>
            
            <p>In general, it is not a good idea to use too many global variables. If you have a bunch of 
            functions in your code, it can be quite challenging figuring out what exactly is happening to your
            variables. Basically, things can get out of hand quickly. However, making a constant a global variable
            is perfectly acceptable since nothing can change it anyway. SALES_TAX_RATE is a constant,
            so I made it global.</p>
            
            <h2>Call by reference</h2>
            
            <p>What if we want a function to change the value of the variables we pass to it?
            Here is an example of a program that does just that: </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbl/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>What the function does is takes in a number, and then cubes it, changing the value of the variable
            you passed to it. Look at the function again: </p>
            
            <p class="indent">void cube(int& num) <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp num = num * num * num; <br/>
            } </p>
            
            <p>The function is void because it isn't returning anything. Instead of having int num as an argument,
            it says int& num. This means that you are passing to the function the address of the variable,
            so that the function can actually make changes to it. Before, we had just been sending copies
            of our variables to our functions. </p>
            
            <h2>Passing arrays to functions</h2>
            
            <p>We can also pass arrays to functions. Here's how: </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbn/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>The program creates an array with 10 elements. Then it calls a function to print the array.
            Then it calls another function to clear out the array and make everything 0.
            Then it prints the array again. </p>
            
            <p>This should help you to understand the utility of functions. We just eliminated a lot
            of repetitive code, and really cleaned up our main. </p>
            
            <p>Let's look at the heading for the clearArray function: </p>
            
            <p class="indent">void clearOut(int arr[], int length) </p>
            
            <p>To pass the array, all we had to do was put square brackets after the name of the array.
            Note the name does not have to be the same as the array you passed to it. To make things easier,
            I also decided to take the length of the array of another argument. Other programming languages
            provide easy ways for you to get the length of an array, but not C++. </p>
            
            <p>Also note that anytime you pass an array to a function, you are passing the array by reference, 
            meaning that the array will not be copied over to the function. Instead you will be passing the 
            address of the array, which means that you can change the contents of the array with your function.
            The reason for this is that for very large arrays, copying the contents would take a very long time. </p>
            
            <h2>How to put functions after main</h2>
            
            <p>I mentioned earlier that main itself is a function. It returns an integer, and it takes no arguments.
            However, main is special since it is where the main execution of a program will take place. 
            Ordinarily, main has to go at the end, after all of the functions you have written. </p>
            
            <p>However, you may want to have your functions go after main. The process of doing is kind of annoying.
            But here's how you do it: </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbp/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>The sayHello function is below the main, as we wanted. But look at the top here. 
            You will see a line that looks like this: </p>
            
            <p class="indent">void sayHello(string); </p>
            
            <p>This is called a function prototype. It looks a lot like the function header for sayHello,
            but there are some differences. You do not need to name the variables that the function takes
            as arguments in your function prototype. Also, there is a semicolon at the end. </p>
            
            <p>For further examples, here all function prototypes for all the functions we have done in this section: </p>
            
            <p class="indent">int rollDice(); <br/>
            float totalCost(float); <br/>
            void cube(int&); <br/>
            void clearOut(int arr[], int); <br/>
            void printArray(int arr[], int); </p>
            
            <p>There are some things to note here. If you are passing a variable by reference,
            you will need to put an ampersand in your function prototype. If you are passing an array,
            you will need to name the array and then put the square brackets after the name of the array. </p>
            
            <p>Now, on to some exercises! </p>
            
            <div id="1" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 1: Area of a circle</h3>

                <p>Write a function that will take in the swap the values of two variables. 
                Make sure you are calling by reference. Write your main so that it will receive user input. </p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="4" class="tabcontent">

                <p>Use this as your test array { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 3, 67, 1006, 321 }. </p>
                
                <p>Write your main so that it will receive a user value. Print the result of the search. </p>

                reversed array. </p>
                
                <p>Use this as your test array { 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 4, 3, 67, 1006, 321 }. </p>
                
                <p>Hint: There are different ways you can do this. What I would do is create an array the
                same size as the one you are reversing, then use a backwards for loop, putting the elements
                of one array into the other. Then you can transfer the contents of the copy array over to the
                original (use a for loop for this). </p>
            </div>
            
            <div id="7" class="tabcontent">
                <h3>Exercise 7: Bubble sort </h3>
                
                <p>You will need your swapping function from before. </p>
                
                <p>Write a function called bubble sort that takes in an array and the length of the array.
                The function will sort the contents of the array from least to greatest. </p>
                
                <p>Here is your test array: {90, 32, 7, 69, 5, 81, 35, 29, 76, 14, 25, 67, 41,
                19, 48, 62, 36, 44, 13, 10} </p>
                <p>There are 20 elements.</p>
                
                <p>This function will use an algorithm called bubble sort. Here is a summary of how it works. </p>
                
                <p>The function will scan through the array. If one element in the array is greater than the 
                one after wards, the two numbers are swapped. The function will continually scan through the
                array until know swaps have occurred, in which case the array will be sorted. </p>
                
                <p>Hint: Use a for loop to scan the array. Use a boolean variable to indicate that a switch
                has occurred. Reset this boolean to false every time you loop through the array. </p>
                 
                <p class="indent">if(arr[i] > arr[i] + 1) <br/>
                { <br/>
                	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp swap(arr[i], arr[i + 1); <br/>
                	&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp swapped = true; <br/>
                } </p>
                
                <p>Great work! Next section will be on advanced topics. There won't be any exercises,
                but if you head on over to the Projects section of the website, you can see some programming
                projects that will put all of your skills to the test! </p>
