            <h1>Lesson 3: Variables</h1>
            
            <p>Now that we have printed a message to the screen, let's lay the groundwork for much more 
            interesting programs. Variables are like containers for holding information. 
            C++ allows you to use different kinds of containers to hold different kinds of data. 
            Here is a list of the different kinds of containers, or variables, you can use.<p>

            <p>1. Integers - Remember from math class that an integer is a number with no decimal point. 
            It can be positive or negative. To create an integer, type this: </p>

	        <p class="indent">int myInteger = 5;</p>

            <p>The first word int, is what lets you create the integer. Following int is the name of the integer,
            so that you can refer to this number later on. Next there is an equal sign followed by the number 5.
            Of course, a semicolon goes at the end. </p>

            <p>To change the value of myInteger. You can simply write out:</p>

            <p class="indent">myInteger = 10;</p>

            <p>Now myInteger is equal to 10.</p>

            <p>2. Floating point numbers - These can be positive or negative, but it can also have a decimal. 
            Here is an example:</p>

	        <p class="indent">float myFloater - 10.789;</p>

            <p>3. Double precision floating point numbers - Much like a float, 
            except these allow for more numbers after the decimal point. </p>

	        <p class="indent">double myDouble = 8.7888888999944445;</p>

            <p>4. Characters - A character can be a single letter, it can be punctuation, 
            or it can even be a newline character '\n', or a null character '\0' </p>

	        <p class="indent">char letterOfTheDay = 'C';</p>

            <p>Notice that the letter is surrounded by single quotes. 
            You have to use single quotes with characters.</p>

            <p>5. Strings - A string is a bunch of characters all strung together. 
            You can use these to hold words, sentences, or even whole novels.</p>

            <p class="indent">string monologue = "Now is the winter of our discontent 
            made glorious summer by this sun of York";</p>

            <p>Strings have to be enclosed in double quotes, presumably because they are more special 
            than simple characters. But that is not all, in order to use strings at all in our program 
            we need to put this at the top: </p>

            <p class="indent">#include &ltcstring&gt </p>

            <p>This will go right after our other include statement. </p>

            <p>6. Boolean - A variable of type boolean can hold one of two possible values, true or false.</p>

        	<p class="indent">bool likesChocolateMilk = true;</p>

            <p>These will be very useful when we get into decision making.</p>

            <p>*George Boole was an English mathematician who developed a system of algebraic logic 
            which would later form the basis for modern computing. His name is used in many different programming 
            languages for holding true or false values.</p>

            <p>One last thing I want to mention. Sometimes, it is a good idea to make a variable constant. 
            By constant I mean that it you will not be able to change after you have created it. Here is an example:</p>

	        <p class="indent">const float PI = 3.14;</p>

            <p>PI is a mathematical constant, so we would never expect it to change. 
            By making it constant, we eliminate the possibility of someone messing it up by accident. 
            Generally, constants will be written out in capital letters so that we know they are constants. </p>

	        <p class="indent">const float SALES_TAX_RATE = 0.075; </p>

            <p>But enough talk, why don't you try playing around with this on your own? 
            Create some of your own variables, and then print them to the screen! 
            See if you can do math with them. </p>

            <p>Here is an example: </p>
            
            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/GhEW/2.js"></script></div>
            
            <ul class="pager">
              <li><a href="2.html">Previous Lesson</a></li>
              <li><a href="4.html">Next Lesson</a></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        
        
    </div>
</body>
