            <h1>Lesson 9: Advanced Topics</h1>
            
            <p>This is where I am going to mention things that I didn't get around to. I am also
            going to introduce some more advanced topics and point you in a direction so that you 
            can learn more about them. </p>

            <h2>Formatting output</h2>

            <p>You will need to #include &ltiomanip&gt to format your output. </p>
            
            <p>Some useful features that you can use include setting the width of a field, aligning text,
            and setting the number of decimal places after a floating point number. </p>
            
            <p>Here is the sales tax program from before, except now I have changed it so that dollar 
            values will be shown to two decimal places: </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbr/1.js"></script></div>

            <p>Normally, the setprecision function shows a value to a given number of significant figures. 
            However, by placing the line cout << fixed in the code, the setprecision function will instead
            show each number to the given number of decimal places. </p>
            
            <p>Another thing we can do is set the width of a particular section of output. 
            This involves using the setw function. </p>
            
            <p>Here is an example: </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbs/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>The setw will set how the minimum width of a field. It goes before the text that you want to
            set the width for. The width also includes the number of characters in the text itself. If the word 
            is too long to fit in the width, the text will overflow into the next field. </p>
            
            <p>By default the text is right aligned in the field. We can change it to left if we want to. 
            We can also use setfill to change the character that we fill the field with. </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbw/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>The setfill and the alignment you can set once if you want to, but the setw will have
            to be put before everything you output. </p>

            <h2>Pointers</h2>

            <p>Pointers are a pretty cool feature of C++. Other languages try to hide pointers from you,
            but C++ is all about them. </p>

            <p>A pointer is a special kind of variable that instead of storing a value like 5 or "Johnny"
            stores the address of another variable. </p>

            <p>Here is an example: </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCbz/1.js"></script></div>

            <p>This is how I can create the pointer. </p>
            
            <p class="indent">int * addressOfNum; </p>
            
            <p>The int* means that the pointer will hold the address of an integer variable. </p>
            
            <p>To put an address in my pointer, I can do this:</p>
            
            <p class="indent">int * addressOfNum = &num; </p>
            
            <p>The ampersand means that I am referring to the address of the variable called num.
            This is how I set the pointer to point to the address of the variable num. </p>
            
            <p>If you notice, when I printed the pointer to the screen we got something that looked like 0x
            followed by letters and numbers. This is how addresses look like in computers. The letters and
            numbers are actually in hexadecimal, which is kind of number system based around the number 16. </p>
            
            <p>To print the value pointed to by the pointer, we use the dereference operator:</p>
            
            <p class="indent">*addressOfNum;</p>
            
            <p>The way I think of it is like that the asterisk is basically telling the pointer to spill
            its guts out. So instead of getting a hexadecimal address, we get the value of num. </p>
            
            <p>Arrays are very closely related to the idea of pointers, since elements in an array are
            supposed to be right next to each other in memory. </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCcB/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>There are some cool things you can do with pointers. Sometimes it is faster to work
            with addresses of information rather than the data itself. </p>

            <h2>Structures</h2>

            <p>Structures are used to group data under one label. Structures are created outside of your main.
            Here is an example so you can see the structure: </p>

            <p class="indent">struct cat <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp string name; <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp float weight; <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp string color; <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp int age; <br/>
            }; </p>
            
            <p>Cat is the name of the structure. Name, weight, color, and age are the members of the structure.</p>
            
            <p>Here is a program the puts the structure to use:</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCcD/0.js"></script></div>
            
            <p>First, I had to create an instance of the cat structure.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">cat myCat;</p>
            
            <p>This works a lot like how we have been creating variables up to now, where we say 
            int num or whatever. Except instead of creating an integer named num, we are creating
            a cat data structure named myCat. </p>
            
            <p class="indent">myCat.name = "Paul"; <br/>
            myCat.weight = 20; <br/>
            myCat.color = "orange"; <br/>
            myCat.age = 15; </p>
            
            <p>You can access the member variables of your structure by typing the name of the
            structure you created, followed by a dot, and then the name of the member variable 
            that you want to access. These member variables can be treated just like any of the
            other variables you have been creating up until this point. </p>
            
            <p>There are other ways to create structures.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">struct cat <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp float weight; <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp string color; <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp int age; <br/>
            }Paul, Tom, Penelope; </p>
            
            <p>This is similar to what we have above, except this time the names of our cats have
            been included next to the structure definition. This means we do not have to create
            instances of our cat data structure, they already created. Here is a program using this: </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCcF/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>Then I had to set the member variables equal to the appropriate values.</p>
            
            <p>Another cool thing you can do with structures is combine them with arrays. This allows you
            to use structures as a handy database tool. </p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCcG/0.js"></script></div>

            <h2>Classes</h2>
            
            <p>Now we are starting to get more into object oriented type stuff, which is beyond what I
            had originally planned for with this site. However, a light introduction should be okay. 
            Just keep in mind that there is a lot more to learn about with this stuff than what I am 
            going to put here.</p>
            
            <p>Classes are like structures, except instead of just holding data they can also have functions.</p>
            
            <p>Here is an example of a class circle:</p>
            
            <p class="indent">class circle <br/>
            { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp float radius; <br/> <br/>
            
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp public: <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp void setRadius(float r) <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp radius = r; <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp } <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp float getRadius() <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp return radius; <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp } <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp float circumference() <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  return 2 * radius * PI; <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp } <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp float area() <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  return radius * radius * PI; <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp } <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp float diameter() <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp { <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  return radius * 2; <br/>
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp } <br/>
            }; </p>
            
            <p>The class circle has a member variable named radius for holding the radius of a circle,
            but there are also functions for calculating the diameter, the circumference, and the area. 
            The public: before the functions just makes it so that we can access these functions outside
            of the class.</p>
            
            <p>Here is a program that puts our circle class to use:</p>

            <div class="program"><script src="//repl.it/embed/HCcJ/0.js"></script></div>

            <p>If you notice, in main we had to create instances of our circle class called myCircle and yourCircle.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">circle myCircle; <br/>
            circle yourCircle; </p>
            
            <p>This is just like creating integers named num1 and num2, except here we are creating circle
            objects and calling them myCircle and yourCircle.</p>
            
            <p>The rest of the main is us calling the various functions belonging to our circle objects.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">myCircle.setRadius(10) <br/>
            myCircle.getRadius() <br/>
            myCircle.diameter() <br/>
            myCircle.circumference() <br/>
            myCircle.area()</p>
            
            <p>These are accessed by putting the name of the object, a dot, and the name of the function we want to use.</p>
            
            <p>This was a really quick intro to object oriented programming. If you want to learn more, 
            I recommend heading over to</p>
